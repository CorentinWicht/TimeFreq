%Calculate Fmax corrected F-test.
%
%EXAMPLE USAGE
% >> test_results = calc_Fmax(data, [], [3, 4], 1e4, 0.05)
%
%REQUIRED INPUTS
% data          - An electrode x time points x conditions x subjects array of ERP
%                 data. Array will vary in number of dimensions based on how many
%                 factors there are
% cond_subs     - Array giving the number of subjects in each condition of
%                 the between subjects factor. For example, if cond_subs is
%                 [8, 9], then there should be 17 subjects with the first 8
%                 being in condition A and the next 9 being in condition B.
%                 For fully within-subjects designs cond_subs = []
% dims          - Dimensions of the data array involved in the effect to be
%                 calculated. For example, if data is an electrode x time points
%                 x Factor A x Factor B x subjects array and you want to
%                 calculated the main effect of A, dims = 3. If you want to
%                 calculate the AxB interaciton, dims  = [3, 4].
% n_perm        - Number of permutations to use to calculate the null distribution
% alpha         - Family-wise alpha level of the test
%
%OUTPUT
% test_results - A struct with results of the Fmax test
