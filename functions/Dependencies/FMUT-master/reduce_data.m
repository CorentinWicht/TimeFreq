%Reduce data to the simplest design that can calculate an equivalent
%effect. For example, for a 3 x 2 design, the main effects can be
%calculated by averaging across the other factor and then conducting a
%one-way ANOVA. Similarly, the interaction effect an be calculated by
%subtracting across the factor with two levels and then conducting a
%one-way ANOVA.
%
%reduce_data performs two computations:
%1. Average across any factors not included in the effect to be calculated
%   (as specified by the dims input)
%2. Subtract across any factors involved in an interaction that have only 
%   two levels (unless all factors have two levels, in which case subtract
%   across all but one factor)
%
%EXAMPLE USAGE
% >> [reduced_data, new_dims] = reduce_data(data, [3, 4])
%
%REQUIRED INPUTS
% data          - An electrode x time points x conditions x subjects array of ERP
%                 data. Array will vary in number of dimensions based on how many
%                 factors there are
% dims          - Dimensions of the data array involved in the effect to be
%                 calculated. For example, if data is an electrode x time points
%                 x Factor A x Factor B x subjects array and you want to
%                 calculated the main effect of A, dims = 3. If you want to
%                 calculate the AxB interaciton, dims  = [3, 4].
%
%OUTPUT
% reduced_data  - data reduced for analysis
% new_dims      - the dimensions of reduced_data that are involved in the
%                 effect
