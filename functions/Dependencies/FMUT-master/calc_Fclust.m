%Calculate F-test cluster mass permutation effect.
%
%EXAMPLE USAGE
% >> test_results = calc_Fclust(data, [], [3, 4], 1e4, 0.05, chan_hood, 0.05)
%
%REQUIRED INPUTS
% data          - An electrode x time points x conditions x subjects array of ERP
%                 data. Array will vary in number of dimensions based on how many
%                 factors there are
% cond_subs     - Array giving the number of subjects in each condition of
%                 the between subjects factor. For example, if cond_subs is
%                 [8, 9], then there should be 17 subjects with the first 8
%                 being in condition A and the next 9 being in condition B.
%                 For fully within-subjects designs cond_subs = []
% dims          - Dimensions of the data array involved in the effect to be
%                 calculated. For example, if data is an electrode x time points
%                 x Factor A x Factor B x subjects array and you want to
%                 calculated the main effect of A, dims = 3. If you want to
%                 calculate the AxB interaciton, dims  = [3, 4].
% n_perm        - Number of permutations to use to calculate the null distribution
% alpha         - Family-wise alpha level of the test
% chan_hood     - A 2D symmetric binary matrix that indicates
%                 which channels are considered neighbors of other 
%                 channels. E.g., if chan_hood(2,10)==1, then Channel 2 
%                 and Channel 10 are nieghbors. You can produce a 
%                 chan_hood matrix using the function spatial_neighbors.m. 
% thresh_p      - The test-wise p-value threshold for cluster inclusion. If
%                 a channel/time-point has a F-value that corresponds to an
%                 uncorrected p-value greater than thresh_p, it is assigned
%                 a p-value of 1 and not considered for clustering.
%
%OUTPUT
