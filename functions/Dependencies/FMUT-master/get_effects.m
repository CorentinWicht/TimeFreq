%Find all effects for a given repeated-measures ANOVA design.
%
%EXAMPLE USAGE
% >> [effects, effects_labels] = get_effects({'Frequency', 'Priming'})
%
%REQUIRED INPUTS
% factor_names   - A cell array of strings of the names of all factors in
%                  the design
%
%OUTPUTS
% effects        - An array with each row specifying the dimensions of the
%                  data array that are involved in each effect
% effects labels - A matching cell array with strings describing each effect
