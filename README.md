# EEG Time-frequency analysis scripts

The MATLAB scripts in this repository enable to compute EEG time-frequency decomposition using Morlet Wavelet transform as well as robust permutation-based statistical analyses with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) to account for multiple comparisons correction.

**OF NOTE: The analysis script can currently only import .set EEG files (see [EEGLAB](https://github.com/sccn/eeglab)).**

## Getting Started

When on the [TimeFreq startup page](https://github.com/CorentinWicht/TimeFreq), start by clicking on `‚¨áÔ∏è Code` on the top right of the screen and then `Download ZIP` to download the whole repository (alternatively you can also clone it). 
Then, you will need to run the scripts **in the following order**:

```
1.TimeFreq_Design.m
2.TimeFreq_Main.m
3.TimeFreq_Figures.m (optional and still in development)
```

You will find below a step by step explanation on how to run each script in MATLAB (by clicking on the `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run` button or on your keyboard's button `‚å®Ô∏è F5`).


### 1.TimeFreq_Design.m

This script is crucial to the proper functioning of the analysis. 

The 7 prompts below will appear sequentially and each prompt will already be filled with default settings and/or examples on how they should be filled: 


#### 1.1. Settings

![](tools/screenshots/Settings.png)

The first prompt enables to set up parameters regarding the time-frequency decomposition.

You can decide to compute 1) `Evoked activity`, 2) `Induced activity` and/or 3) `Intertrial coherence`.\
For a deeper understanding between these three measures see:\
* [Herrmann, C.S., Rach, S., Vosskuhl, J. et al. Time‚ÄìFrequency Analysis of Event-Related Potentials: A Brief Tutorial. Brain Topogr 27, 438‚Äì450 (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10548-013-0327-5)
* [Herrmann, C. S., Grigutsch, M., & Busch, N. A. (2005). EEG oscillations and wavelet analysis. In T. C. Handy (Ed.), Event-related potentials: A methods handbook (pp. 229-259). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38135661_EEG_Oscillations_and_Wavelet_Analysis)

Additionally, you can either import a `TimeFreq_Design.mat` and/or a `TimeFreq_Bands.mat` files (Y)  or create new ones (N).

Finally, you can decide to :
```
* Average reference your EEG files before the time-frequency decomposition
* Restrict the time-window for statistics inside the time-range of your ERP
* Apply a power spectrum normalization as routinely performed by EEGLAB (i.e. 10 x Log10)
```


#### 1.2. Inputs ERP

![](tools/screenshots/InputsERP.png)

The second prompt enables to define EEG files-specific settings.

Hence, you will have to provide the prompt with:
```
* The sampling rate of your EEG files (all files should have the same sampling rate)
* The 1) lowest and 2) highest frequency of interest for the time-frequency decomposition 
* The number of permutations to compute robust, non-parametric statistics (i.e. the higher the number of permutations, the slower the computation)
* The alpha threshold for statistics
* The relative tolerance level (also called Epsilon), for additional information see:
```
[D. Iatsenko, P. V. E. McClintock and A. Stefanovska, Linear and synchrosqueezed time-frequency representations revisited: Overview, standards of use, reconstruction, resolution, concentration, and algorithms, Dig. Signal Proc. 42, 1-26 (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsp.2015.03.004)


#### 1.3. Design Definition

![](tools/screenshots/DesignDef.png)

The third prompt enables the definition of the statistical design.

These are the designs that are currently accepted:
```
* 1 between-subjects factor
* 1 within-subjects factor
* 1 between- & 1 within-subjects factors
* 2 between-subjects factors
```
There can only be **up to 2 levels for each factor !**

There is already an example that shows you how to fill the first two columns, namely on the... :
```
* First line you should indicate whether Factor1 is a Between-subjects (B) or Within-subjects (W) factor
* Second line you should give a name to the Factor
* Third and fourth lines you need to define the name of each levels.\
```
**The last point is case-sensitive since the name you pick as levels should match either a pattern in your EEG files or the name of subfolders in which you separated the files.**

Additionally, you have the possibility to ignore specific `folder(s)` and/or `file(s)` that are inside the EEG files-containing upper folder.\
For example, if you would like to ignore every EEG files that contains the pattern `_EXCLUDE`, just write this pattern in the first box under the `IgnoreFiles` header.

**Once you are done, press on the cross `X` on the top-right corner and the code will resume**


#### 1.4. Save Design Variables

![](tools/screenshots/SaveDesign.png)

The fourth prompt asks you to provide a path were to save the **TimeFreq_Design.mat** file containing the design definition variables (can be directly re-imported next time).


#### 1.5. Frequency Bands Definition

![](tools/screenshots/FreqBands.png)

The fifth prompt enables to defined up to twelve frequency bands of interest. 

For each band of interest, you need to provide a name in the first column `Bands` and then the lower and upper frequency bounds for that band in the `Boundaries` column. 

**Once you are done, press on the cross `X` on the top-right corner and the code will resume**


#### 1.6. Save Frequency Bands Variables

![](tools/screenshots/SaveFreqs.png)

The sixth prompt asks you to provide a path were to save the **TimeFreq_Bands.mat** file containing the frequency bands definition variables (can be directly re-imported next time).


#### 1.7. Import TF Decomposition

![](tools/screenshots/ImportTF.png)

The last prompt enables you to import a time-frequency decomposition previously generated by the second script.

Since the decomposition requires heavy computation and is, de facto, time-consuming, you can decide to reimport the decomposition if you just want to perform the statistics separately (in this case press `Yes`).


Once you are done with this last prompt, the script will generate a `TimeFreq_Param.mat` file containing all the parameters necessary for the second script.

You can now run the second script. 


### 2.TimeFreq_Main.m

This second script is the one running the time-frequency decomposition as well as computation of statistics.

Depending on your design and your hardware the computation might take several days. 

Again, click on the `‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run` button or on your keyboard's button `‚å®Ô∏è F5` to run the script.\
You don't need to provide any additional information, it will automatically import the parameters that were exported by the [first script](# 1.TimeFreq_Design.m). 

Once the compution is finished there will be a message in MATLAB Command Window:

```
The script is done!
```

The data are saved based on your Current Folder location (i.e. run `pwd` in MATLAB Command Window to know where is the working directoy) accordingly:

```
üìÅ [Working directory]
 ‚Ü≥ üìÅ [Exports_DD-MM-YY_HHMM]

| FILES | Content |

|RawTFData.mat|Matlab data file including one variable for each type of time-frequency metric (e.g. Induced).\ Each variable is a meta-structure containing substructures for each Task, Condition, etc. (depending on your design).\ Finally, you will find two substructures "Data" and "Freqs" wich include matrices for, resp. the time-frequency decomposition and the list of frequency bins for each EEG data file included in the analysis|
|ActivityType_TaskName_Condition_FrequencyBand.mat.mat|Matlab data file containing two substructures "TFCE" and "Clusters".\ The "TFCE" one includes X substructures depending on your design (e.g. 3 substructures for a 2x2 design). Inside each design-specific structure there are 4 matrices:\"Obs" = F/T-values\"TFCE_Obs = TFCE-corrected F/T-statistics\"maxTFCE = Maximum TFCE value for each permutation map\"P_Values" =  TFCE thresholded P_values|
